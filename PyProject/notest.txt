1. parse the data from xml
2. transform the data to desred format
3. save all data to csv


I have used python library ElemnetTree. it has parse() method  and this method returm ElementTree object. that gets stored on tree

iter() method return iterator object which is each xml element object it returns


for loop
inner loop gets executed
then outerloop

The extend() method adds all the elements of an iterable (list, tuple, string etc.) to the end of the list.

 record_arr = record_arr[1:] exp:
from the first element to last lement all data gets stored to list record_arr.
